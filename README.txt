# Automated Spreadsheet Processor

**Version 1.0.0**

This project uses the openpyxl library to automate of repetitive tasks on spreadsheets. The "transactions.xlsx" file shows a hypothetical company's transaction IDs, product IDs, and initial price. 

Following a discount offered by the company, the calculation of discounted prices, 10% discount in this case, was created to facilitate accurate and efficient discounted price computation and saving on the spreadsheet.

A bar chart was also applied to present the date and demonstrate the functions.
